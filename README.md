## Repository Overview

- **Branch-Based Progression:**  
  - Each branch functions as a "folder," thematically grouped around increasing levels of complexity and subject matter.
  - Earlier branches focus on foundational concepts and introductory AI projects.
  - Successive branches introduce more advanced theories, tools, and practical implementations as I deepen my expertise.
  - This hierarchy allows contributors and learners to follow a logical, incremental AI learning path.

- **Project Contents:**  
  - Projects may include Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, datasets, readme files, and references.
  - Each project folder is self-contained and typically includes documentation with objectives, methodology, and outcomes.
  - Projects span topics such as machine learning basics, neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, generative models, explainable AI, and cutting-edge research.
